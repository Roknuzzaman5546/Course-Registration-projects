UseState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.
First of all we declared a usestate in blogs jsx with which we showed the course information on the display.
